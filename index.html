        <h1>My Interests</h1>
        <p>1. I really like playing games as that is my passion and I am the best at everything when i play by myself
            because no one else is playing.</p>
        <p>2. When I sleep I recover energy for my body so I like sleeping as well since its good for the body which
            makes it an overall good thing to do.</p>
